# 🛡️ Mastercard Cybersecurity Job Simulation (Forage)

This repository contains my completed tasks from the **Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program** hosted on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/). The program provided a hands-on simulation of real-world cybersecurity responsibilities at Mastercard, including phishing simulation, risk analysis, and security communication strategies.

## ✅ Task Overview

### 📧 Task 1: Design a Phishing Email Simulation

**Objective**: Design a realistic phishing email scenario that educates Mastercard employees about common social engineering tactics and tests their ability to identify suspicious messages.

**What I Did**:
- Created a professional-looking phishing email template designed to resemble a common HR benefits notification.
- Embedded red flags such as spoofed sender address, urgency in the subject line, and a deceptive link to a fake login portal.

**Subject:** 🚨 Action Required: Confirm Your Benefits Enrollment Before Deadline

**From:** hr-benefits@mastercard-benefits.com  
**To:** John Doe

**Date:** 12/6/2025



Dear John,

We hope this message finds you well. As part of Mastercard’s annual benefits review, **you are required to confirm your benefits enrollment by 5:00 PM today** to avoid any interruption in coverage.

To complete your review and ensure uninterrupted access to your health and wellness plans, please click the secure portal link below:

👉 [Verify My Benefits Now](http://mastercard-benefits-verify.com)

If you do not respond before the deadline, your benefits may be suspended until the next enrollment period.

Thank you for your prompt attention.

Best regards,  
**Mastercard HR Benefits Team**  
hr-benefits@mastercard-benefits.com

- Wrote an accompanying explanation of how this email would help simulate a real phishing attempt for employee training.

# 🛑 Red Flags Analysis – Phishing Email Simulation

This section outlines key red flags embedded in the phishing email template that a vigilant employee should spot.

---

### 1. 🚩 **Suspicious Email Address**
- `hr-benefits@mastercard-benefits.com`  
  This domain is **not** Mastercard’s official domain (`mastercard.com`). It appears legitimate but is subtly altered.

---

### 2. ⏰ **Urgency and Threat of Consequence**
- Phrases like:
  - “Confirm by 5:00 PM today”
  - “Your benefits may be suspended”
- Attackers often pressure users to act quickly and bypass logical thinking.

---

### 3. 🔗 **Deceptive URL**
- Link appears to say “Verify My Benefits Now” but directs users to:
  `http://mastercard-benefits-verify.com`  
  A domain clearly **not associated** with Mastercard.

---

### 4. 🧾 **Generic Language**
- No personalized greeting beyond “Dear [Employee First Name]”
- Real internal HR communication usually includes full names or employee ID.

---

### 5. 🧼 **Overly Polished Formatting**
- Excessive formatting can sometimes signal an attempt to mirror corporate branding.

---

### ✅ Purpose of These Red Flags

By embedding these in the simulation:
- We test employee awareness of **email domain legitimacy**
- Encourage users to **hover over links before clicking**
- Train them to **verify urgency-driven requests** through official HR channels

---

**Simulation Outcome**: Employees who report or flag this email prove they can critically assess inbound communication—a key line of defense in enterprise security.

---

**Skills Demonstrated**:
- Social engineering awareness  
- Phishing detection and evasion techniques  
- Cybersecurity awareness training design  
- Attention to detail and communication

---

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Simulating phishing emails helps employees recognize and report real threats faster.
- Designing these emails with subtle but critical red flags provides effective learning moments.
- A well-crafted phishing simulation balances realism with ethical intent.
